            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <p class="lead font-italic text-center">The boring stuff that no one actually asked for!</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Why a new pony music archive?</h4>
            <p>
                Ever wanted to listen to some artist, but they have 3 aliases, cleaned pony out of their Youtube,
                and you're never sure which music site might be missing what song?<br/>
                The reason for the archive is to keep all the fandom music in one easily accessible place.<br/>
                That and with the <a href="https://ponyvillelive.com/mlpma">MLP Music Archive</a> being essentially dead,
                we needed to preserve all the awesome songs released since then!<br/>
            </p>

            <h4>Where does all that music come from?</h4>
            <p>
                Nowadays a large part of the archive comes from public download links,
                Bandcamp, Soundcloud,and other music collections.<br/>
                Historically most of the songs came from <a href="https://pony.fm">Pony.fm</a>
                (a large fandom music site) and the MLP Music Archive v16.<br/>
                About 15GB of music were submitted through the website, and more through other channels.<br/>
                We've recently also merged in all of the Brony Music Archive, EqBeats Archive
                and the <a href="https://horsemusicherald.com/">Horse Music Herald</a>'s playlist.
            </p>

            <h4>I'm an audiophile, and what do the quality levels actually mean?</h4>
            <p>
                We source songs from the best source we can find: FLAC, or the highest-quality MP3 available, usually V0 or 320.
                After some sorting and tagging, this becomes the raw version.<br/>
                The high-quality archive is the same contents transcoded to Opus 1.3.1 VBR C10 @ 96kbps,
                which is close to transparent (shows no or imperceptible distortions in listening tests).<br/>
                The phone version is Opus @ 60kbps, it aims for high compression and absolutely will have distortions,
                but not enough to be annoying on cheaper audio hardware (or if you have imperfect hearing!).
            </p>

            <h4>So how many FLACs and compressed songs are there then?</h4>
            <p>
                Since many fan songs were never released in FLACs (or any sort of acceptable quality for that matter),
                currently about 35% of the raw archive is lossless and the rest is in MP3.<br/>
                We always try to find good sources for the music, however sometimes there just isn't any to be found.<br/>
                Take for example "I Am Best Pony" by Circuitfry, from Remix War Vol. 2, by far the worst in the archive.
                This song is only available as a mind-blowing 8kb/s, 22kHz MP3 (but hey, in stereo!).<br/>
                The file of course sounds like hot garbage, and confuses most music software into thinking it's half an hour long,
                until playing through the actual 5 minutes of it.
            </p>

            <h4>I have a previous version, do I need to download everything again?</h4>
            <p>
                The short answer is yes, the archive can't be upgraded in-place without leaving old files behind.<br/>
                That's because when folders are renamed or re-organized for the new version
                your torrent client doesn't know how to find them anymore.<br/>
                Which means they get downloaded again and the old version isn't removed,
                so you would end up with a bunch of duplicates everywhere.
            </p>

            <h4>Is this taking away Youtube views / iTunes sales from artists?</h4>
            <p>
                If you can afford to, and if you find some songs you like in there, please support your favorite artists.
                If you can't, Soundcloud, <a href="https://pony.fm">Pony.fm</a>, or Bandcamp are equally free to listen to. <br/>
                This archive simply keeps everything in one place and preserves a lot more rare content.
                As of this release, no artist has requested that we take down any song from the archive.<br/>
                We genuinely hope to help people discover new or underappreciated pony music, so that some of them may turn into new fans.
            </p>

            <h4>How is the archive maintained?</h4>
            <p>
                Small scripts help automate the maintenance and cleanup, however please don't hesitate to report any issue you may find.<br/>
