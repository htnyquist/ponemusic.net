            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The Pony fandom has produced an amazing amount of music of all kinds,
                welcome to its largest, organized, high-quality music archive!<br/>
                For the September 2019 release we've gathered 40,000 tracks from 3,000 artists plus 200 compilation albums.<br/>
                <br/>
                Consider this a spiritual successor to the <a href="https://ponyvillelive.com/mlpma">MLP Music Archive</a>,
                but actively maintained and gathering songs from the best sources available.
                The archive updates every six months, so make sure to check back on March 1st.<br/>
                <br/>
                The Raw archive consists of 115 GB of compilation albums and 615 GB of single tracks.
                You'll find both brand new releases, and old archived content from the early years of the fandom.

                The High Quality version is recommended if you just want to listen.<br/>
                It's designed so that you shouldn't hear the difference with the Raw version.<br/>
                If you're short on space, Phone Quality is very compact and still sounds fine.

                Because browsers can't download this much in one go, we use Torrents for the archive.
                As a bonus, this allow you to pick and choose what folders you want to download. <br/>
                If you don't already have a Torrent client, try one of these:
                <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php">qBittorrent</a>,
                <a href="https://www.utorrent.com/desktop/">ÂµTorrent</a>, or
