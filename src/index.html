            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The Pony fandom has produced an amazing amount of music of all kinds,
                welcome to its largest, organized, high-quality music archive!<br/>
                For the March 2021 release we have 53,000 tracks by 3,300 artists and 250 compilation albums.<br/>
                <br/>
                As always, this update brings both new tracks (including a G5 one!) and old archived content from the early years of the fandom.<br/>
                While we're all waiting to learn more about G5, the music side of the fandom is still going strong!<br/>
                <br/>
                You can consider this project a spiritual successor to the <a href="https://ponyvillelive.com/mlpma">MLP Music Archive</a>,
                but actively maintained and gathering songs from the best sources available.
                The archive updates every six months, so make sure to check back on March 1st for the next release!<br/>

                The High Quality version is recommended if you just want to listen.<br/>
                It's designed so that you shouldn't hear the difference with the Raw version.<br/>
                If you're short on space, Phone Quality is very compact and still sounds fine.

                Because browsers can't download this much in one go, we use Torrents for the archive.
                As a bonus, this allow you to pick and choose what folders you want to download. <br/>
                If you don't already have a Torrent client, try one of these:
                <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php">qBittorrent</a>,
                <a href="https://picotorrent.org/">PicoTorrent</a>, or
                <a href="https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download">Deluge</a>.
